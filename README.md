# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Connie!

I am a Visual Artist and Photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. My journey has taken me through various creative landscapes, from the fine arts to digital photography, where I've honed my skills in visual storytelling. Now, I'm exploring the fascinating intersection of art and technology by integrating code into my portfolio.

## My Creative World
ðŸ“¸ Photography: Specializing in portrait and event photography, I use my camera to tell compelling stories and evoke emotions. My work often explores themes of identity, nature, and the passage of time.

ðŸŽ¨ Visual Arts: With a background in painting, drawing, and mixed media, I bring a unique perspective to my photographic work. My artistic journey informs my approach to composition, colour, light and detail.

ðŸ’» Merging Art & Technology
As I deepen into the world of coding, I'm excited to enhance my portfolio with interactive and dynamic elements that showcase my work in innovative ways. On my GitHub, you'll find projects where creativity meets technology, such as:

 - Interactive Photo Galleries: Coding custom, responsive galleries to create immersive experiences for viewers.
 - Portfolio Website: Building a personal website from scratch to feature my artwork, photography, and creative projects.
 - Accessible by design: Every element is crafted to ensure maximum accessibility.

ðŸŒ± Always Learning
I believe that creativity knows no bounds, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to express my artistic vision. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, or experimenting with web design, I'm always learning and growing.

ðŸ“« Let's Connect
I'm always open to collaboration, whether it's on artistic projects or coding initiatives that bring art and technology together. Feel free to check out my repositories, star projects that inspire you, or reach out for potential collaborations!
